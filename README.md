Certainly! Here's a `README.md` file that you can include with your .NET 8 Web API project:

# Swift MT799 Processor Web API

This is a .NET 8 Web API designed to accept, parse, and store Swift MT799 message files. It processes incoming Swift MT799 messages, extracts important fields, and saves the data to a SQLite database for further use.

## Features

- **Receive Swift MT799 Messages:** Accept Swift MT799 messages via HTTP POST requests.
- **Parse Messages:** Extract key fields from the Swift MT799 message.
- **Store Data:** Persist the extracted data into a SQLite database.
- **Logging:** Logs operations and errors using NLog.
- **API Documentation:** Swagger UI is provided for easy testing and API documentation.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- Optional: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/) for testing API endpoints.
- Optional: [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) for viewing the database.

```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SwiftMT799Processor.git
cd SwiftMT799Processor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the .NET 8 SDK installed. Restore the project dependencies using:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Update Database Connection String

In `appsettings.json`, ensure the SQLite connection string points to your desired database file location:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=SwiftMT799.db"
}
```

### 4. Run the Application

To start the application, use:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will be accessible at `https://localhost:5001/` (or `http://localhost:5000/` for HTTP).

### 5. Access Swagger UI

Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI to test the API:

- Navigate to `https://localhost:5001/swagger` in your web browser.

### 6. Sending a Swift MT799 Message

You can send a Swift MT799 message using various tools:

#### a. Using Swagger UI

1. Go to the `POST /api/SwiftMT799` endpoint.
2. Click "Try it out".
3. Input the Swift MT799 message content in the request body.
4. Click "Execute".

#### b. Using Postman

1. Create a new POST request.
2. Set the URL to `https://localhost:5001/api/SwiftMT799`.
3. Select "raw" and "Text" in the Body tab.
4. Input the Swift MT799 message and click "Send".

#### c. Using `curl` Command

```bash
curl -X POST https://localhost:5001/api/SwiftMT799 -d ":20:123456789\n:21:987654321\n:79:This is a narrative text of the Swift MT799 message." -H "Content-Type: text/plain"
```

### 7. View Stored Data

Use an SQLite database browser like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to open the `SwiftMT799.db` file and inspect the `SwiftMT799Messages` table.

## Logging

Logs are generated by NLog and stored in the `Logs` directory. You can adjust logging configurations in the `nlog.config` file.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot connect to SQLite:** Ensure the connection string in `appsettings.json` is correct and the database file is accessible.
- **API not reachable:** Make sure the application is running and check the URL and port configuration in `launchSettings.json`.
